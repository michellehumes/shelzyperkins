          "body": "# The Amazon Hack Nobody Talks About\n\nHey!\n\nYesterday I got a message asking how I always find such great deals. So I'm sharing my #1 secret:\n\n## Price Tracking\n\nBefore buying ANYTHING over $30 on Amazon, I check its price history. Here's how:\n\n1. Install the **CamelCamelCamel** browser extension (free)\n2. It shows you if the current price is actually a good deal\n3. Set alerts to get notified when prices drop\n\n**Why this matters:** Amazon prices change constantly. That '50% off' sale? Sometimes it's from an artificially inflated price. This tool shows you the REAL deal history.\n\n## This Week's Actually Good Deals\n\n[WEEKLY_DEALS_PLACEHOLDER]\n\nThese are verified good prices (I checked!).\n\nTalk soon,\nShelzy\n\nP.S. Reply to this email if you have any questions - I read every message!"
