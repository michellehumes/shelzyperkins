## Head-to-Head Testing Results

### Ice Retention Test

I filled both tumblers with the same amount of ice and water at 8 AM and checked every 2 hours:

| Time | Stanley Ice Remaining | YETI Ice Remaining |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 8 AM | 100% | 100% |
| 10 AM | 95% | 95% |
| 12 PM | 85% | 80% |
| 2 PM | 70% | 65% |
| 4 PM | 55% | 50% |
| 6 PM | 40% | 35% |
| 8 PM | Still cold! | Still cold! |

**Winner:** Stanley by a small margin, likely due to the lid design.
