## Best Skincare Dupes

### 1. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (Dupe for: Paula's Choice)

**Why I love it:** This serum minimizes pores and controls oil just as effectively as options 3x the price.

**What it does:**
- Reduces appearance of pores
- Controls excess oil
- Brightens skin tone

**My results:** Visible improvement in pore size within 2 weeks.

**Expensive version:** $74 for 1oz
**Amazon dupe:** $18.99 for 1oz

**The difference?** Essentially none. Both contain encapsulated retinol that's gentle yet effective.
