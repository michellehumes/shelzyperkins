## Tips for Actually Staying Organized

**1. Start with One Room**
Don't overwhelm yourself. Pick the room that bothers you most.

**2. Measure First**
Nothing worse than buying organizers that don't fit. Measure your spaces!

**3. Declutter Before Organizing**
Can't organize clutter. Donate/toss first, then organize what's left.

**4. Group Like Items**
All baking supplies together, all cleaning supplies together, etc.

**5. Label Everything**
Labelmaker = $15. Never forgetting what goes where = priceless.

**6. Maintain Weekly**
Spend 10 minutes per week putting things back where they belong.
