<p class="sp-legal-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 2024</p>

<p class="lead">In the interest of full transparency, I want to be upfront about how ShelzyPerkins.com makes money and how this might affect the content you see.</p>

<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p><strong>ShelzyPerkins.com contains affiliate links.</strong> If you click on a product link and make a purchase, I may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you. This is how I support the site and keep bringing you great content!</p>

<h2>Amazon Associates Disclosure</h2>
<p><strong>ShelzyPerkins.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</p>

<p>As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. This means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When you click on a link to Amazon from this site, it may be an affiliate link</li>
    <li>If you make a purchase within a certain timeframe after clicking, I may earn a commission</li>
    <li>The price you pay is the same whether you use my affiliate link or not</li>
    <li>You will never pay more because you clicked through my site</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Affiliate Tag</h2>
<p>All Amazon links on this site use the affiliate tag: <strong>shelzysdesigns-20</strong></p>

<h2>How This Affects My Content</h2>
<p>Here's what I want you to know about how I approach affiliate content:</p>

<h3>What I WILL Do:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Only recommend products I genuinely believe are worth your money</li>
    <li>Clearly disclose when posts contain affiliate links</li>
    <li>Share my honest opinion, even about products I'm affiliated with</li>
    <li>Update prices when I notice they've changed significantly</li>
    <li>Remove or note products that are no longer available</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I WON'T Do:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Recommend a product just because it has a high commission</li>
    <li>Hide the fact that I earn from affiliate links</li>
    <li>Exaggerate product benefits to make a sale</li>
    <li>Recommend products I haven't researched or don't believe in</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Potential Partnerships</h2>
<p>In addition to Amazon Associates, I may occasionally:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Partner with brands for sponsored content (always clearly labeled)</li>
    <li>Receive products for review purposes</li>
    <li>Use affiliate links from other retailers</li>
</ul>

<p>Any sponsored content or gifted products will be clearly disclosed in the relevant post.</p>

<h2>Why I Use Affiliate Links</h2>
<p>Running a website costs money – hosting, domain fees, email services, and countless hours of research and content creation. Affiliate commissions help me:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep the site running and ad-free (or with minimal ads)</li>
    <li>Invest in better tools and resources for finding deals</li>
    <li>Spend more time creating helpful content for you</li>
    <li>Purchase products to test and review</li>
</ul>

<p>When you use my affiliate links, you're directly supporting this site at no cost to yourself. Thank you!</p>

<h2>Price Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Amazon prices change frequently – sometimes multiple times per day. While I try to keep prices accurate, the price you see when you click may differ from what's shown on my site. Always verify the current price on Amazon before purchasing.</p>

<h2>Product Availability</h2>
<p>Products featured on this site may go out of stock or be discontinued. If you click a link and find the product unavailable, I apologize for the inconvenience. I try to update posts regularly, but I can't catch everything!</p>

<h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
<p>This disclosure is provided in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."</p>

<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this disclosure or my affiliate relationships, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>. I'm happy to be transparent about how this site operates!</p>
