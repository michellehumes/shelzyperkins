- Reply to every comment within the first hour
- Ask questions back: "What color would you pick?"

### Engagement Bait
- End videos with a question
- Use "Comment [word] for tutorial"
- Create polls: "Which color are you?"
- Use "Tag someone who needs this"

### Cross-Post
- Instagram Reels (same content, longer caption)
- Remove TikTok watermark with SnapTik
