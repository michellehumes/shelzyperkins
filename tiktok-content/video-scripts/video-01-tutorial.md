Okay so everyone keeps asking how I make these personalized water bottles, so here's your tutorial. First, download the Pecita font from dafont.com — it's free. Open Canva or Cricut Design Space, type your name, size it to about two inches tall, and send it to your Cricut. Use permanent outdoor vinyl so it's dishwasher safe. That's literally it.
