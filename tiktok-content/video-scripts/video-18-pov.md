## AI Voiceover Script

Copy this into CapCut TTS or ElevenLabs:

```
So everyone keeps asking how I make these, and honestly it's so easy. Download the Hello Honey font, type your name, size it to 2 inches, and send it to your Cricut. Use permanent outdoor vinyl so it's dishwasher safe. That's literally it.
