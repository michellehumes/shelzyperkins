## AI Voiceover Script

Copy this into CapCut TTS or ElevenLabs:

```
Weeding is honestly so therapeutic once you get the hang of it. The key is to go slow, especially on cursive letters. Apply transfer tape, smooth it down, line it up on your bottle, burnish it, and peel back slowly. That's the satisfying part.
