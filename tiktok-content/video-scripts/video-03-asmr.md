2. Speed up the cutting portion to 2x or 3x
3. Keep the reveal at normal speed (that's the money shot)
4. Add text overlays at timestamps above
5. If using original audio, boost the Cricut sounds
6. If adding music, keep it quiet (30% volume)
7. Add auto-captions (optional for this one)
8. Export 1080p 60fps

## Pro Tips

- Film multiple names being cut in one session
- Get CLOSE - the closer the shot, the more satisfying
- Clean your mat before filming (no old vinyl scraps)
- Good lighting makes the vinyl colors pop
- The reveal at the end is crucial - go slow on the peel
