## AI Voiceover Script

Copy this exactly into CapCut TTS or ElevenLabs:

```
Weeding is honestly so therapeutic once you get the hang of it. The key is to go slow, especially on the cursive letters. Then apply your transfer tape and smooth it down really well. Line it up on your bottle, burnish it down with a scraper or even a credit card works, and then the best part — peel it back slowly. And just like that, you've got a custom water bottle.
```
