## AI Voiceover Script

Use TikTok's built-in Text-to-Speech to read the text dramatically:

```
if no one got me... i know my... personalized script water bottle... got me
```

(The TTS reads this line by line as text appears)

## Text Overlays (Add in CapCut)

These appear one at a time with fade-in effect:

| Timestamp | Text |
|-----------|------|
| 0:00-0:02 | "if no one got me..." |
| 0:02-0:04 | "i know my..." |
| 0:04-0:06 | "personalized script water bottle..." |
| 0:06-0:08 | "got me" |

   - Or use keyframes: Start at 100%, end at 120%
3. Add text overlays with "Fade In" animation
4. Time each text to appear 2 seconds apart
5. Add TikTok TTS voiceover reading the text
6. Add emotional background music
7. Export 1080p 60fps
