VIDEO 1: TUTORIAL
================================================================================

Okay so everyone keeps asking how I make these personalized water bottles, so here's your tutorial. First, download the Pecita font from dafont.com — it's free. Open Canva or Cricut Design Space, type your name, size it to about two inches tall, and send it to your Cricut. Use permanent outdoor vinyl so it's dishwasher safe. That's literally it.

================================================================================

Here's everything you need. Number one: white flip-top water bottle from Amazon, twelve dollars. Number two: permanent outdoor vinyl, I use Cricut brand but any works. Number three: transfer tape. Number four: weeding tools. And obviously a Cricut. Total cost per bottle is around fifteen dollars, and you can sell them for thirty-five to forty-five. The math is mathing.

VIDEO 6: WEEDING TUTORIAL
================================================================================

Weeding is honestly so therapeutic once you get the hang of it. The key is to go slow, especially on the cursive letters. Then apply your transfer tape and smooth it down really well. Line it up on your bottle, burnish it down with a scraper or even a credit card works, and then the best part — peel it back slowly. And just like that, you've got a custom water bottle.
