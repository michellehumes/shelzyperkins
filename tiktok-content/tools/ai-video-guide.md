### Ready-to-Use HeyGen Scripts:

**Script 1: Product Intro (30 sec)**
```
Hey! So everyone keeps asking where I get these personalized water bottles, and honestly, I make them myself.

I use the Pecita font, which is free from dafont.com, size it to about 2 inches, and let my Cricut do the rest.

The vinyl is dishwasher safe, and I can make any name you want. DM me if you want one - they're only $25!
```

**Script 2: Color Options (20 sec)**
```
Okay so which color should I make next? I've got hot pink for my bold girlies, baby pink for the soft girl era, gold for main character energy, rose gold for the romantics, teal for the creative ones, and black for mysterious vibes. Comment your color!
```

**Script 3: Order Announcement (15 sec)**
```
Yes, I sell these! Custom water bottles starting at $25. You pick the name, pick the color, and I ship in 3 to 5 days. DM me "order" to get started!
