## Filming Tips

### Lighting
- Natural light from a window is best
- Face the light (don't have it behind you)
- Film between 10am-2pm for best light
- Use a ring light ($20-30) for consistent lighting

### Camera Setup
- Use a phone tripod for stable shots
- Overhead angle for hands/process shots
- Eye-level for product reveals
- Get CLOSE for satisfying details

### Audio
- Film in a quiet room
- Cricut sounds = ASMR gold
- You'll replace most audio with voiceover anyway
